     * Quirks of query()
     *
     * In iOS, the amount of datapoints is limited to 1000 by default.
     * You can override this by adding a limit: xxx to your query object.
     * In iOS, datapoints are ordered in an descending fashion (from newer to older).
     * You can revert this behaviour by adding ascending: true to your query object.
     * In Android, it is possible to query for "raw" steps or to select those as filtered by the Google Fit app.
     * In the latter case the query object must contain the field filtered: true.
     * In Google Fit, calories.basal is returned as an average per day, and usually is not available in all days.
     * In Google Fit, calories.active is computed by subtracting the basal calories from the total.
     * As basal energy expenditure, an average is computed from the week before endDate.
     * While Google Fit calculates basal and active calories automatically,
     * HealthKit needs an explicit input from some app.
     * When querying for activities, Google Fit is able to determine some activities automatically
     * (still, walking, running, biking, in vehicle), while HealthKit only relies on the input of
     * the user or of some external app.
     * When querying for activities, calories and distance are also provided in HealthKit (units are kcal and meters) and
     * never in Google Fit.
     * When querying for nutrition, Google Fit always returns all the nutrition elements it has,
     * while HealthKit returns only those that are stored as correlation. To be sure to get all stored the quantities
     * (regardless of they are stored as correlation or not), it's better to query single nutrients.
     * nutrition.vitamin_a is given in micrograms in HealthKit and International Unit in Google Fit.

     * Quirks of queryAggregated()
     * In Android, to query for steps as filtered by the Google Fit app, the flag filtered:

     * When querying for activities, calories and distance are provided
